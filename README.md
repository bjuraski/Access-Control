# Access-Control

Hardware and software support for the Access Control System with an interactive graphical touch screen interface was developed.
Access control is achieved by entering a numeric password. Protection against unauthorized access to
the object was increased with Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm for generating a random permutation of a finite sequence while entering
the password and programmed motion detection with alarm advertising and sending SMS alerts. 
The system is implemented on an STM32 microcontroller based on ARM processor architecture. 
The interaction between the components is performed through serial communication.
GUI with a touch screen interface to display system functionality was developed in the Nextion Editor development tool.
Additional settings changes provide password change both for access and alarm, password length, unlocked state duration before the automated lock, and phone number change.
